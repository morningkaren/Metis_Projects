# Metis_Projects

At Metis, I created some interesting end to end projects. 

A linear regression project is on Go Fund Me which  predicted how much of the goal amount
could be fundraised based on factors like the goal amount, the category of fundraiser, and the fundraiser's description
is one of the projects.

Another project is a poetry generator using a recurrent neural network (LSTM). A user can input part of a poem and
the poetry generator will continue the poem for him or her.

An NLP project that analyzes Disney movie scripts and their original stories is also included. A recommendation system
is also part of the project. It is in the form of a flask app and recommends a story or a movie a user would like to 
read or watch given a previous film or story they have watched or read and some weights to the sentiment and plot similarity
of the previous film or story.

A classification project which classifies whether a child in the Western Pacific is suicidal or not given 
the child's answers to other survey questions and some miscellaneous facts about the country the child lives in
is also included.
